# Great-Schools-Ratings

I am interested in scraping greatschools.org ratings to determine several things:

See if there is a correlation between total enrollment, students per teacher, and percentage of low income students and outcomes such as college readiness, college enrollment, and test score ratings.

I will first build a web scraper to scrape the data from greatschools.org for the state of Texas. This analysis will be limited in scope to public high schools.

Once the data is ingested and in a workable format, I will clean the data and perform an exploratory data analysis.

Finally, I will perform the following hypothesis test:
Null: There is no difference between college enrollment percentages and percentage of low income students
Alternative: Schools with a higher than state average percentage of low income students have lower college enrollment percentages.
